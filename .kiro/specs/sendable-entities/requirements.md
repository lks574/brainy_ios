# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Domain entities in the Brainy iOS app need to be properly Sendable-compliant to ensure thread safety in concurrent environments. Currently, the entities are marked as Sendable but the enums they depend on are not, which can cause compilation issues and potential thread safety problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Domain entities to be properly Sendable-compliant, so that they can be safely used across different threads without data races.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Domain entities are used in concurrent contexts THEN the system SHALL ensure thread safety without compilation warnings
2. WHEN enums are used within Sendable entities THEN the enums SHALL also conform to Sendable protocol
3. WHEN the code is compiled THEN there SHALL be no Sendable-related warnings or errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all supporting enums to be Sendable, so that Domain entities can properly conform to Sendable without using @unchecked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN QuizCategory enum is used in Sendable contexts THEN it SHALL conform to Sendable protocol
2. WHEN QuizType enum is used in Sendable contexts THEN it SHALL conform to Sendable protocol  
3. WHEN QuizMode enum is used in Sendable contexts THEN it SHALL conform to Sendable protocol
4. WHEN QuizDifficulty enum is used in Sendable contexts THEN it SHALL conform to Sendable protocol
5. WHEN AuthProvider enum is used in Sendable contexts THEN it SHALL maintain its existing Sendable conformance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to avoid using @unchecked Sendable, so that the code maintains proper compile-time safety guarantees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Sendable conformance THEN the system SHALL NOT use @unchecked Sendable annotations
2. WHEN all dependencies are properly Sendable THEN entities SHALL use standard Sendable conformance
3. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN all Sendable conformance SHALL be verified at compile time
